## [1. University Information System](UnivesityInformationSystem.java)
Imagine you are working on a "student information system" for a university, which stores information about its students, such as their names, ages, average scores, and whether they graduated or not. 
Variables representing these parameters are declared incorrectly in the system's code.
 
**Task:** 
Fix the errors so that the system can print the values.

## [2. Chess Tournament Scores](ChessTournamentScores.java)
You are making a program for a chess tournament, that needs to calculate the points earned by a player.
A win is worth 1 point, while a tie is worth 0.5 points.
The given program declares two variables: wins and ties with the corresponding values.

**Task:**
Create a program to calculate and output the points earned by the player.
Multiply the ties value by 0.5, to get the points earned for ties.

## [3. Tip Calculator](TipCalculator.java)
You always tip 15% of the bill amount. 
To make the calculation easier, you decide to write a program that will do that for you.

**Task:**
Take the bill amount as input and output the corresponding tip amount, which should be 15% of the amount.
To calculate 15% of a number, multiply it by 15, then divide by 100.
The input amount can be a decimal, so take a double from the input.

## [4. Boiling Water](BoilingWater.java)
You are making a program for a water sensor that should check if the water is boiling.

**Task:**
Take the integer temperature in Celsius as input and output "Boiling" if the temperature is above or equal to 100.
Output "Not boiling" if it's not.

## [5. Boxes](Boxes.java)
You are making a robot that should categorize items by their color.
Each color corresponds to a box with a specific number.

For simplicity, our program will handle 3 colors:
red goes to box #1
green goes to box #2
black goes to box #3

**Task:**
Your program needs to take a color as input and output the corresponding box number.

## [6. The Emotion Aware Robot](TheEmotionAwareRobot.java)
Your robot can recognize your emotions and can assign them a number to represent each of them:

You are happy!
You are sad!
You are angry!
You are surprised!
The given code takes the emotion number as an user input.

**Task:**
Complete the code to output the corresponding message in the given format.
If the input is an emotion that the program doesn’t know, it should output: "Unknown emotion".

## [7. Age Group](AgeGroup.java)
Given the age of a person as an input, output their age group.

**Task**
Here are the age groups you need to handle:
Child: 0 to 11
Teen: 12 to 17
Adult: 18 to 64

## [8. Sum While](SumWhile.java)
Your math teacher asked you to calculate the sum of the numbers 1 to N, where N is a given number.

**Task:** 
Take an integer N from input and output the sum of the numbers 1 to N, inclusive.
