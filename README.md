## [1. University Information System](UnivesityInformationSystem.java)
Imagine you are working on a "student information system" for a university, which stores information about its students, such as their names, ages, average scores, and whether they graduated or not. 
Variables representing these parameters are declared incorrectly in the system's code.
 
**Task:** 
Fix the errors so that the system can print the values.

## [2. Chess Tournament Scores](ChessTournamentScores.java)
You are making a program for a chess tournament, that needs to calculate the points earned by a player.
A win is worth 1 point, while a tie is worth 0.5 points.
The given program declares two variables: wins and ties with the corresponding values.

**Task:**
Create a program to calculate and output the points earned by the player.
Multiply the ties value by 0.5, to get the points earned for ties.

## [3. Tip Calculator](TipCalculator.java)
You always tip 15% of the bill amount. 
To make the calculation easier, you decide to write a program that will do that for you.

**Task:**
Take the bill amount as input and output the corresponding tip amount, which should be 15% of the amount.
To calculate 15% of a number, multiply it by 15, then divide by 100.
The input amount can be a decimal, so take a double from the input.

## [4. Boiling water](BoilingWater.java)
You are making a program for a water sensor that should check if the water is boiling.

**Task:**
Take the integer temperature in Celsius as input and output "Boiling" if the temperature is above or equal to 100.
Output "Not boiling" if it's not.
